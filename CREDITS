!ratbox is not just ircd-ratbox anymore.
The following people people are guilty of bringing it in here:

sd, Karel Tuma <karel.tuma -at- gmail.com>
jilles, Jilles Tjoelker <jilles -at- stack.nl>
 
The codebase is largely built on top of ircd-ratbox, developed by:
 
AndroSyn, Aaron Sethman <androsyn -at- ratbox.org>
anfl, Lee Hardy <lee -at- leeh.co.uk>
jilles, Jilles Tjoelker <jilles -at- stack.nl>

Special thanks for support, code and ideas to:

Hwy, W. Campbell <wcampbel -at- botbay.net>
larne, Edward Brocklesby <ejb -at- sdf.lonestar.org>
 
Of course our work is based on the work of many, many others over the past
10 or so years since irc has existed, including the work done by the Hybrid
team, our thanks goes to them.
